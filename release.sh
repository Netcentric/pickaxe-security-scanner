# What does this script address:
# - Maven Release Plugin insists on creating a tag, and git-flow also wants to create a tag.
# - Secondly, the Maven Release Plugin updates the version number to the next SNAPSHOT release before you can
#   merge the changes into master, so you end with the SNAPSHOT version number in master, and this is highly undesired.
#
# This script solves this by doing changes locally, only pushing at the end.
# All git commands are fully automated, without requiring any user input.
# See the required configuration options for the Maven Release Plugin to avoid unwanted pushs.

# Based on the excellent information found here: http://vincent.demeester.fr/2012/07/maven-release-gitflow/

# The version to be released
releaseVersion=""

# The next development version
developmentVersion=""

# Provide an optional comment prefix, e.g. for your bug tracking system
