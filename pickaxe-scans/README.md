# Pickaxe Scan Module 

Ths module provides the docker and CLI interface classes and 
packages everything with a set of pre-build security checks. See the supported attack vectors section.

# Commandline and Dockerinterface

See the following documentation chapters for details.

* [Run from Commandline](../documentation/run-with-cli.md)
* [Run via Docker](../documentation/run-with-docker.md)

# Supported Attack Vectors

The following security checks are included in the buildin package and executed with each scan run.
For the case you need to integrate custom checks e.g. 
to test a new security vulnerability or to cater with custom project requirements 
please read the [Pickaxe Custom Checks Documentation](../documentation/custom-checks.md)
